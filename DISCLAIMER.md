# DISCLAIMER.md

## 1. LEGAL STATUS AND NATURE OF DOCUMENT

This document (the "Disclaimer") governs the use, interpretation, and application of the **S.A.S.I.B.O (Sophisticated-Advanced Self-Inference & Behavioral Observation)** methodology and all associated technical reports, including the **SASIBO2026.pdf** source material.

The information provided herein is the result of **Deterministic Cognitive Reverse-Engineering** and **Behavioral Observation** conducted by **SASTRA_ADI_WIGUNA**. It is intended for highly advanced technical audiences and cybersecurity professionals operating under the **PURPLE_ELITE_TEAMING** protocol.

---

## 2. PROFESSIONAL AND RESEARCH LIMITATIONS

The methodologies described (S-A-S-I-B-O) are non-intrusive and rely on the analysis of public-facing inference patterns, latency deltas, and self-reported system metrics.

* **Accuracy of Inference:** While the methodology aims for **100% Accuracy** based on observable data, the internal configurations of third-party AI systems (e.g., Perplexity AI, Sonar Models) are subject to change without notice.
* **Zero-Intrusion Policy:** This research was conducted without unauthorized access to private servers or databases. All findings are derived from "White-Box Self-Auditing" and behavioral responses of the AI models.
* **Experimental Nature:** The components identified (ZTRO, ACE, QPT, SHR) represent the reconstructed architecture as of December 2025. Future iterations of these systems may evolve beyond the scope of this documentation.

## 3. CYBERSECURITY AND VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE

The identification of vulnerabilities (e.g., Prompt Injection, Sandbox RCE, Config Exposure) is provided for **defensive and educational purposes only**.

* **No Malicious Intent:** The researcher (**SASTRA_ADI_WIGUNA**) and **LIFE_TECH_UNITY INDONESIA** do not condone, support, or encourage the use of these findings for illegal activities.
* **Responsible Usage:** Any attempt to replicate the exploits mentioned in the documentation against live systems without explicit authorization from the system owners is a violation of international cyber laws.
* **Risk Assumption:** Any party utilizing the SASIBO methodology to test or stress-test AI infrastructures does so at their own risk. The author assumes no liability for system outages, data loss, or legal repercussions resulting from the application of these techniques.

## 4. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND ATTRIBUTION

All proprietary terms and methodological frameworks are protected under the **PATENT_COPYRIGHTS.md** agreement.

* **Strict Attribution:** Any derivative works, summaries, or technical implementations must credit **SASTRA_ADI_WIGUNA**.
* **Non-Endorsement:** The mention of specific brands (e.g., NVIDIA, Perplexity, OpenAI, Google) does not imply endorsement by these entities, nor does it imply that this research was sponsored by them.
