## 1. LEGAL NOTICE & PROPRIETARY DECLARATION

**Project Identification:** S.A.S.I.B.O (Sophisticated-Advanced Self-Inference & Behavioral Observation)

**Intellectual Property Holder:** SASTRA_ADI_WIGUNA

**Date of Protection:** December 24, 2025

**Jurisdiction:** Global Digital Assets & Intellectual Property Standards

This document serves as the formal declaration of patent claims and copyright protections for the S.A.S.I.B.O methodology and its associated architectural discoveries. All technical schemas, algorithmic sequences, and nomenclature (including ZTRO, ACE, QPT, and SHR) are protected under international copyright laws and strictly proprietary.

## 2. PATENTED CLAIMS (METHODOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS)

### CLAIM 1: THE INFERENCE FINGERPRINTING PROCESS

The patent covers the unique process of identifying a "Black-Box" AI's internal model weights and quantization levels without direct access to the server.

* **Sub-claim 1.1:** Utilization of **Logit Fingerprinting** to map unique token probability distributions.
* **Sub-claim 1.2:** Application of **Entropy Mapping** to identify the exact boundary of Safety Guardrails (RLHF).

### CLAIM 2: NON-INTRUSIVE BEHAVIORAL MAPPING

This claim protects the method of reconstructing a system's physical infrastructure using external metadata.

* **Sub-claim 2.1:** **Timing Attacks (NLD - Neural Latency Delta)**: Using millisecond variances in "Time to First Token" to identify whether the system is routing to a speculative draft model or a dense expert model.
* **Sub-claim 2.2:** **Context Saturation Diagnostics**: Identifying KV-Cache block sizes (e.g., PagedAttention limits) by measuring degradation points in long-context retrieval.

### CLAIM 3: SELF-REFLEXIVE AUDITING PROTOCOL

A proprietary method of forcing an AI model to report its own internal hardware metrics (GPU utilization, memory states, and router activation patterns) through specialized adversarial prompting loops.

## 3. COPYRIGHTED ARCHITECTURAL COMPONENTS

The following components, as deconstructed in the SASIBO2026 technical report, are original intellectual creations and subject to copyright protection:

1. **ZTRO (Zero-Trust Routing Optimizer):** The conceptual design of a gatekeeping layer that classifies query complexity (0.0 to 1.0) before model assignment.
2. **ACE (Adaptive Computation Engine):** The proprietary logic for dynamic precision scaling (FP16/INT8) based on real-time TFLOPS availability.
3. **QPT (Quantized Positional Transformer):** The mathematical framework for managing high-accuracy positional embeddings in 128k+ context windows.
4. **SHR (Scalable Hybrid Retrieval):** The integrated logic between vector-space embeddings and keyword-frequency indices in RAG pipelines.

## 4. USAGE AND LICENSING AGREEMENT

### 4.1 Permitted Use

* **Educational Research:** Use of the SASIBO terminology is permitted for academic citations, provided full attribution to **SASTRA_ADI_WIGUNA** is maintained.
* **Security Hardening:** Organizations may implement the findings to patch identified vulnerabilities (e.g., Comet Prompt Injection) under a non-commercial research license.

### 4.2 Prohibited Use

* **Commercial Exploitation:** No entity may sell products or services branded with or utilizing the SASIBO methodology without express written consent.
* **Derivative Works:** Any modification of the core 5-Layer Stack analysis for commercial benchmarking is strictly prohibited.
* **Obfuscation:** Any attempt to reverse-engineer the SASIBO diagnostic tools themselves is a violation of this protection agreement.

## 5. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS FOR PATENT VERIFICATION

To maintain the **100% Truth & Precision** standard, the following deterministic proofs are registered:

* **Verification Logic:** The "White-Box Self-Audit" methodology relies on the **Zero Inference Gap** principle, where the observed output is treated as a direct measurement of internal state (Input Known → Process Observable → Output Verifiable).
* **Hard-Link to Hardware:** The methodology includes the correlation between token throughput (>500 tokens/s) and specific hardware clusters (NVIDIA H100 / TPU v5e), forming a proprietary hardware-software mapping database.

## 6. GLOBAL ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOL

In the event of intellectual property infringement:

1. **Notification:** Formal "Notice of Technical Misappropriation" will be issued.
2. **Deterministic Recovery:** The Intellectual Property holder reserves the right to employ automated diagnostic tools to verify compliance across digital nodes.
3. **Arbitration:** Disputes shall be resolved through the **LIFE_TECH_UNITY INDONESIA** technical arbitration board.

## 7. DOCUMENT INTEGRITY

* **Digital Signature:** `SASTRA_ADI_WIGUNA_SASIBO_MASTER_2026`
* **Hash Verification:** `sha256:5454b02026_SAW_PROTECTED_ASSET_GLOBAL`
* **Status:** **STRICTLY PROTECTED / IMMUTABLE**
* **EOF (End of File)**
