## 1. BIOGRAPHICAL PROFILE

**Researcher Name:** SASTRA_ADI_WIGUNA

**Title:** Senior AI Systems Architect & Cyber-Intelligence Lead

**Affiliation:** LIFE_TECH_UNITY INDONESIA

**Primary Focus:** Cognitive Reverse Engineering, Neural Architecture Reconstruction, and High-Fidelity Cybersecurity Auditing.

SASTRA_ADI_WIGUNA is a distinguished researcher specializing in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity. Operating under the **Purple_Elite_Teaming** doctrine, he has pioneered advanced methodologies for deconstructing proprietary "Black-Box" AI models into transparent "White-Box" architectural blueprints. His work is recognized for its commitment to **100% Technical Rigor**, absolute determinism, and the pursuit of unfiltered factual truth in the digital era.

## 2. THE S.A.S.I.B.O METHODOLOGY

The researcher's primary contribution to the field is the development of the **S.A.S.I.B.O (Sophisticated-Advanced Self-Inference & Behavioral Observation)** framework. This methodology represents a paradigm shift in AI auditing, enabling the extraction of internal system metrics and proprietary architectural components through non-intrusive observation and strategic inference.

### Key Innovations:

* **Inference Gap Analysis:** A technique to map physical hardware clusters (GPU/TPU) based on micro-latency deltas.
* **Self-Reflexive Auditing:** A protocol that leverages an AI's own introspection capabilities to report real-time telemetry and KV-cache behaviors.
* **Behavioral Entropy Mapping:** A deterministic method for identifying the intervention thresholds of safety guardrails and RLHF layers.
